# sparky5
Sparky5 is designed to identify and characterize calcium fluctuations in T cells that have been labeled with a calcium indicator dye, live imaged, and tracked using IMARIS (RRID: SCR_007370). It can measure when calcium fluctuations start and stop (duration), the relative level of calcium fluxed (amplitude), instantaneous and average track speed, cell displacement, and more.
